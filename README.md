# Sales-Tableau-Dashboard
I am excited to share my recent Tableau Dashboard showcasing valuable insights into "Super Store Sales," implemented just last week. The dataset, generously provided by Information Technology Institute (ITI), underwent a comprehensive analysis.

Steps were covered:

Data Exploration:
  Thorough examination for Missing and Duplicate Values.
Data Cleaning:
  Removal of Duplicate, blank, and irrelevant data.
Data Preprocessing:
  Creation of new attributes for enhanced data analysis.
Data Visualization:
  Development of an Interactive Dashboard featuring Key Performance Indicators, Trends, and Slicers.
